# pynepcord
PyNepCord is a simple Python module that allows you to interact with [NeppedAPI](https://api-docs.neppedcord.top/).

# Getting started
The first thing to do is to get your personal token to access the API and, of course, install the library. 
 
First, get your personal token. Instructions are given [here](https://api-docs.neppedcord.top/start/auth). 

# Requirements
The installation is quite simple. However, to install this library you need to install some dependencies, which is obvious. All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, but apart from that you will probably need `git` if you plan to install the library from GitHub repo.

# Installing from repository
To install a library from a GitHub repository, you must first install the `git` package, or clone the repository to your computer (or whatever device you are using, whatever, an android phone with Termux :shrug:).
```bash
# Installing from repository
$ pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/NellyD3v/pynepcord

# Finally, let's check if the library is available :)
$ python3 -m pynepcord

# It's done!
```
